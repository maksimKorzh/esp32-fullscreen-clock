# How to install it
    I used Arduino IDE with esp32 board + FabGL library being installed.
    Once you're able to upload default FabGL examples to your esp32 this
    sketch should be no problem to upload as well. However you'll 99.9%
    would run into a problem of not having a proper video resolution and
    text positioning on your screen so try your luck with some other resolutions
    available here: http://www.fabglib.org/fabglconf_8h_source.html
    To reposition the text on screen change the coords on lines 27 and 29 in clock.ino
